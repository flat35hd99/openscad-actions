# eval openscad
OpenSCAD environment on github actions

## Usage

Set `scad_file` and `output_file` with extension you want to build.
If needed set `options` as openscad command line options.

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - name: Setup
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Build stl file
    uses: flat35hd99/openscad-actions@v1.3
    with:
      scad_file: test/test.scad
      output_file: test.stl
      options: "-D var=value -hardwarnings"
```

This workflow create `test.stl` file at working directory.

You can use built file like:

```yaml
- name: Upload stl file as artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: built_stl
    path: test.stl
    options: "-D var=value -hardwarnings"
```
